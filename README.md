# -555-Timer-PCB-Design-Astable-Mode
This project features the complete schematic and PCB layout of a 555 Timer circuit configured in astable mode. The design generates a continuous square wave pulse, ideal for use in LED blinking, pulse generation, or clock input for digital circuits.
ðŸš€ Project Showcase: 555 Timer PCB Design

I recently completed a compact and functional PCB design for the classic NE555 timer IC, configured in astable mode. This design generates continuous square wave pulses â€” perfect for applications like LED blinking, tone generation, or simple clock signals. ðŸ’¡

ðŸ”§ Key Features:

Designed in [ðŸ”·Your Tool, e.g., EasyEDA/KiCad/Proteus]

Operates with a 5Vâ€“12V DC supply

Compact layout using DIP-8 555 timer

On-board LED output for easy testing

Includes decoupling capacitor for stability

ðŸ’¼ Whether you're a beginner in electronics or revisiting the basics, the 555 timer is a timeless IC with endless use cases â€” and designing a PCB around it is a great way to sharpen layout skills!
